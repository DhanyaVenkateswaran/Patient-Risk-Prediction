# Patient-Risk-Prediction
The Real-Time Patient Risk Identification project aims to develop an innovative system for real-time identification of patient risks in healthcare settings. By leveraging advanced technologies and data analysis techniques, the project seeks to enhance patient safety and improve healthcare outcomes.
The project focuses on continuous monitoring of patient data, including vital signs, electronic health records, medication records, and other relevant information. Real-time data streams are processed using sophisticated algorithms and predictive models to identify potential risks faced by patients. The system integrates machine learning and data analytics to analyze patterns and trends in the data, allowing for early detection of risks. By applying predictive modeling techniques, the project can proactively identify patients at high risk for adverse events, such as infections, medication errors, or deteriorating health conditions.
